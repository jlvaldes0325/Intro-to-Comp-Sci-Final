# Intro-to-Comp-Sci-Final
Final Project for Comp Sci
Project Title: Dungeon Rush

Members: Jorge Valdes, Christian Ingram

Description: For every turn the player selects from three weapons to fight a randomized enemy. The weapons each hold certain values in two attributes: strength and speed. These attributes will add a buff to the player's randomized roll for attack. If the player's roll exceeds the randomized value for the enemies attributes (health and agility) then the attack will hit and the duel is won. After each duel the player gains an xp point that can be added to either strength or speed as a permanent buff. The enemies get increasingly stronger and the game goes until the player dies or reaches a certain level number. We will use Object Oriented programing with a class system for the weapons and one for the characters with health and agility such as the player and the enemies. We will also utilize variables to hold player score count and level number. While the project sounds semi complicated it is reasonable and not impossible to do with python.
